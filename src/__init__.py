# Active Circuit Discovery
"""
Active Inference-guided circuit discovery in large language models.
Uses circuit-tracer for attribution graphs and an uncertainty-weighted
selector for efficient feature-level interventions.

Main Components:
- circuit_analysis: Circuit discovery via circuit-tracer backend
- experiments: Real experiment runner (run_real_experiments.py)
- core: Data structures and metrics
