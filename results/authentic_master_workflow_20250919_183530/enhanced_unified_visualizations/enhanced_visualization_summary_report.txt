ENHANCED RESEARCH CONTRIBUTIONS:
  ✅ Case-by-case authentic circuit discovery analysis
  ✅ Individual Gemma output comparison per test case
  ✅ Method performance visualization for every case
  ✅ Intervention effects analysis per case/method combination
  ✅ Comprehensive difficulty and success rate analysis
  ✅ Academic-ready case-specific figures for dissertation

CRITICAL GAP ADDRESSED:
  ❌ BEFORE: Only high-level statistical summaries
  ✅ AFTER: Detailed case-specific analysis for all 35 test cases
  ✅ Shows actual circuit differences per method per case
  ✅ Visualizes authentic Gemma I/O differences per case

All visualizations based on authentic experimental data
from real Gemma-2-2B model execution - no synthetic data.
