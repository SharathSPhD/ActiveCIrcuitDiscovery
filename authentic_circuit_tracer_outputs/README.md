# AUTHENTIC CIRCUIT-TRACER OUTPUTS

This directory contains authentic circuit-tracer outputs that are preserved
from the original experiments:

## Contents:
- authentic_circuit_tracer/: Original authentic circuit-tracer outputs
- circuit_tracer_authentic/: Native circuit-tracer visualizations
- authentic_circuit_graphs/: Generated circuit network graphs
- refact4_visualizations/: REFACT-4 authentic visualizations

## Note:
These are the ONLY visualization outputs that should be considered authentic.
All other visualization scripts have been archived to maintain data integrity.

## New Unified System:
For all new visualizations, use the unified_authentic_visualizer.py system
which integrates with the master workflow and generates academic-ready figures
based on authentic Gemma-2-2B model execution results.
